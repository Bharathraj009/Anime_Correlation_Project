# Anime_Correlation_Project

The code provides a comprehensive data analysis workflow, from loading and cleaning data to visualizing relationships and performing correlation analysis. Each step prepares the data for deeper insights, particularly in understanding how different features relate to each other within an anime dataset.

## Lessons Learned

- **Data Cleaning:** Emphasized the importance of preprocessing data, including handling missing values and removing duplicates.
- **Data Types:** Enhanced my understanding of different data types and their impact on analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Improved my ability to calculate and interpret correlation matrices.
- **Visualization:** Gained proficiency in using plots (scatter, box, heatmap) to visualize data relationships.
- **Library Skills:** Strengthened my coding skills with libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Challenges Faced

- **Data Quality:** Addressed issues with missing values and incorrect data types by implementing systematic cleaning processes.
- **Correlation Interpretation:** Learned to avoid overgeneralizing correlations by deepening my understanding of statistical concepts.
- **Crowded Visuals:** Overcame the challenge of overcrowded plots by filtering data and adjusting visualization parameters.
- **Debugging:** Resolved errors related to data types by using print statements and checking DataFrame properties.
- **Learning Curve:** Familiarized myself with libraries through documentation and tutorials, which helped build my confidence.

Overall, this project significantly enhanced my technical skills and analytical thinking, turning challenges into valuable growth opportunities, particularly in data preparation and visualization.
